a) We need to make sure if we have  indexes on the fields that are in our WHERE statements and ON conditions

b)  We need to double  check if we really need LEFT JOINS, if not needed then we should  use INNER JOINs.

c) If the performance is still an issue after tweaking your query, we need to consider deformalizing your schema to eliminate joins

d) WE may also  need to  reduce  the load on the database by using caching applications like sphinxsearch and memcached

e) We need to make sure our joins are only to actual tables and not views.
